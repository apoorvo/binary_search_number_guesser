# Binary Search

Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

# Application

I have used this algorithms to make a number guesser that guesses a number you think of between 1 and the range you set (upto 1 billion). 
The application also shows the number of guesses it requires and the probablity of getting it right randomly.

# How to play?
All you have to do is think of a number and tell wether it's higher or lower than the guessed number. Simple right? Now let's see if you can beat the machine?
